##Game design mistakes to avoid:

###1. starting too big.
- design feature by feature
- keep games simple, add content when you are satisfied with current
- ASK rule = Avoid Starting Kingdoms

###2. not considering how to onboard the player
- consider learning curve
- include tutorials

###3. being too committed to an idea
- interapt, adapt or let it go if an idea is not working out

###4. creating an overly rigid design
- you are creating the experience, but not controlling it
- games should be flexible and fun -> add open-world elements or add secondary or thirtiary paths, which palyers can follow

###5. focusing on a story too much upfront

###6. underestimating polish
- feature can't be done enough!
- "a delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad"

###7. arbitrarily adding things
- every feature should be througly thought about
